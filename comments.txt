"With that in mind, the UML association diagram below shows the models we'll define 
in this case (as boxes). As discussed above, we've created models for the book (the 
generic details of the book), book instance (status of specific physical copies of 
the book available in the system), and author. We have also decided to have a model 
for the genre so that values can be created dynamically. We've decided not to have 
a model for the BookInstance:status â€” we will hard code the acceptable values 
because we don't expect these to change. Within each of the boxes, you can see the 
model name, the field names and types, and also the methods and their return types."

Essentially, any dropdown values in the website should be modeled in the database
insead of hard coding it in the HTML dropdown list. This allows for easier change
for adding new options. The given example above is 'Genres'; sure you can hard code 
each genre, but it becomes difficult as more genres are defined over time.
